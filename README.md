# Group Project: Acid deposition in Sweden
This is a public version of our repository for our assignment for the course of Ecological methods.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> In this repository you can find our raw data and scripts. Feel free to inspect them and contribute by commenting. Its our first attempt on using GitHub in order to deal with big data. After one month of working together we are happy that we did our best to overcome the distance from Sweden all the way to Australia. The only way for us to evolve is and your feedback. </p>
